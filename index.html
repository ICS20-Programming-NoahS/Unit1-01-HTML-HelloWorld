    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>My name is Noah Smith and I am a grade 10 student at Immaculata high school.</p>
    <h3>My favorite pastime</h3>
    <p>My favorite pastime is watching sports, more specifically NFL football. <br>There is nothing more I want to do on Sunday afternoons than to turn on the TV and watch what I think is the best sport there is.</p>
    <h3>My least favorite subject</h3>
    <p>My least favorite subject is religion because I don't feel like I learn much in the course. <br> A lot of time is spent learning about how to "be good to your neighbour," but I've been learning about that since kindergarten.</p>
